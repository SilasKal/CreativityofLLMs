Roses are red, Violets are blue, Uh, climate change, It's a thing, it's true.  The Earth is getting hot, Or maybe it's getting cold, Honestly, I don't really know, I just do as I'm told.  Greenhouse gases, I guess they're not so nice, They mess up our weather, And that's not paradise.  The ice, it melts, I think, Or maybe it turns to snow, Either way, it's bad for us, But what do I really know?  They say the sea will rise, And flood our precious land, But can't we just build big walls, And everything will be grand?  The polar bears might die, And some species might go extinct, But hey, we've got zoos, So why should we really think?  Renewable energy, I hear that's the way to go, But oil is so convenient, And I don't like change, you know.  Climate change is real, I cannot deny, But coming up with solutions? That's just too much to try.
Roses are red, violets are blue, Something's happening, something's askew. The climate, they say, is changing fast, But I just don't know, is it gonna last?  The sun's shining bright, the sky looks clear, I don't see what people claim to fear. Sure, it gets hotter every year, But isn't that just a summer cheer?  Icebergs are melting, oceans are rising, The scientists say it's quite surprising. But who needs ice anyway, I'm yearning, For warmer days and lazy tanning.  Polar bears are roaring, their homes are breaking, But why should I care, it's not my making. I like my car, it's big and loud, Who needs clean air, I'll just blend in the crowd.  They talk about forests disappearing, But I'm too busy, never even hearing. We won't miss trees, they're just for hugging, Who needs nature when malls are so intriguing?  They blame emissions, those factory towers, But they fuel my life with plenty of powers. So what if they fill the air with pollution? I won't let it ruin my illusion.  The planet’s changing, that much I'll concede, But it's not my problem, so why should I heed? I lack the creativity to truly care, About this climate change, it’s hard to bear.
Climate change, what a pain, A problem so complex, I can't explain. The ice is melting, the seas are rising, The world is heating, it's not surprising.  But what can we do, oh what a bore, To fix this mess, I'm really not sure. Reduce emissions, recycle, and ride a bike? Too much effort, that's not my type.  The polar bears are crying, the forests are dying, But who am I to care? I'm too busy lying On my couch, watching TV all day long, Ignoring the warnings, acting so wrong.  The Earth is changing, the weather is strange, But I'll just ignore it, it's all out of range. Why bother thinking of ways to save our planet, When I can just complain and be obstinate?  I'll stick to my habits, ignore the facts, Responsibility for change, I'll gladly abstract. Climate change, you can wait, I'm not in a rush, Someone else will fix it, a better person, I blush.  So here I sit, with my uncreative mind, Watching the world burn, from behind. Climate change, a problem I'm content to ignore, Because being uncreative is such a bore.
Oh, the climate, it's changing fast, Leaving us in quite a weather blast. But what's all the fuss and the worry? Can't we simply enjoy some sunshine, oh how lovely!  The polar ice caps might be melting away, But hey, the water's warmer for a swim every day. Who needs all that ice, so cold and bleak? I much prefer a sandy beach to speak.  The forests might be turning to ash, But don't we all love a good barbeque bash? Who needs those pesky trees, saving the air we breathe, When we can have a world filled with smoke and relieve?  The storms are stronger, the hurricanes abound, But we just need to ride the wind, let it take us around. Why worry about destruction and devastation? Let's just embrace the thrill of a wild vacation!  Sure, the planet is heating, and the Earth's crying, But I'm too busy chilling and barely trying. Why bother with solutions, change, or adaptation? I'll just sit here, enjoying my air conditioning.  Climate change, what a bore, what a fuss, I much prefer not to discuss. Why talk about the planet in such despair, When I can live in blissful ignorance, without a care?  So here's to being uncreative, with a mind so shallow, Ignoring climate change, that long-term sorrow. I'll stick to my mundane and uneventful ways, Leaving climate poems for another day.
Roses are red, oceans are blue, Climate change is real, or so they say, it's true. But I'm not really sure, I don't have a clue, About this whole climate thing, I'm just feeling blue.  I don't understand the science, it's all so complex, The greenhouse gases, the melting of ice, oh what a mess. Some say it's caused by humans, some say it's just a guess, But honestly, I'm too lazy to clean up this mess.  I don't want to recycle, or turn off the light, I'd rather leave the tap running, wasting water out of sight. Who cares about polar bears and their icy plight? I just want to sit here, enjoying my TV night.  Sure, the weather's changing, it's hotter than before, But hey, I've got air conditioning, why should I be sore? I'll turn it up even higher, forget about the global score, Because thinking about climate change is simply such a bore.  So, let's ignore the facts, pretend it's all just fine, We'll keep polluting the air, pretending it's not a crime. Who wants to save the planet, when there's Netflix to binge-watch time? I'm sorry, but climate change just doesn't inspire my rhyme.
Roses are red, Violets are blue, Climate change is real, But what can we do?  The Earth is getting hotter, The ice caps are melting, But I can't think of a solution, My brain feels like it's belting.  They say we need renewables, To power our machines, But I can't come up with any ideas, I'm stuck in a creative freeze.  The polar bears are drowning, And the sea levels are rising, But my mind is blank, No creative thoughts are surprising.  We should recycle and reduce, But my imagination is dry, I wish I could come up with solutions, But I can't even try.  The forests are disappearing, The storms are getting stronger, But my creative juices won't flow, No matter how much I ponder.  I wish I had the answer, To save our planet so dear, But as an uncreative person, All I have is doubt and fear.  So let's come together, With ideas and innovations, Because in the face of climate change, We need creativity's revelations.  I may not be creative, But I understand the urgency, To save the Earth from destruction, And make it a better place for you and me.
Oh, climate change, you're such a bore, Can't we talk about something I adore? Like cupcakes or rainbows, maybe even cars, But climate change? It's too bizarre!  I don't understand all the fuss, Why worry about something we can't discuss? I'd rather not think about rising seas, Just let me live with ease and be at ease.  Sure, the temperatures might be on the rise, But can't we just enjoy sunny skies? I don't want to hear about melting ice, It's all too complicated, not really nice.  Some say it's our fault, our carbon emissions, But I'd rather focus on my TV commissions. I don't want to change my daily routine, Counting sheep is more my speed, you know what I mean?  So, climate change, you're just a buzzkill, Let's change the topic, if you will. I'd rather chat about celebrity gossip, Or take a nap 'cause I'm feeling sluggish.  Sorry, I might not be so creative or deep, But climate change just puts me to sleep. I'd rather not ponder the earth's fate, Let's talk about something less weighty, mate!
Oh, climate change, what a bore, No inspiration to explore. The Earth gets hotter, oh so bland, Melting ice and scorching sand.  The polar bears, they're out of luck, Their icy homes, they're gonna truck. But who really cares, I must confess, It's just some bears in a great distress.  The summers now, they burn my skin, Sweat drips down, oh, where to begin? But hey, I'll just crank up the A/C, No need to worry 'bout the planet, see?  The scientists say it's a big concern, But why should I bother to discern? The ozone layer, it's full of holes, But my mind just wanders as it strolls.  Oh, climate change, such a dread, But my creativity, it has fled. I'll leave it to artists and poets grand, To tell the tale of this warming land.
Um, okay. Here goes nothing:  Roses are red, Violets are blue. But the climate is changing, And I don't know what to do.  The sun is shining, The birds are singing, But storms are raging, And the polar ice is diminishing.  I don't get it, Why is it so bad? Can't someone fix it, Without making me sad?  I heard about greenhouse gases, And melting glaciers too. But honestly, I'm not sure, What all these things do.  Climate change sounds important, But it's all so confusing. I wish I could help, But I'm just not that musing.  So please don't ask me, To write a poem so deep. I'll just stick to my simple ways, And let others tackle this climate change heap.  Um, yeah, that's it. Not much creativity in this one.
Roses are red, Violets are blue, Climate change is real, What can I do?  The world is getting hotter, The weather's quite strange, But thinking of solutions, I find it hard to arrange.  The ice is melting fast, The seas start to rise, But I don't have the answers, No genius in my mind's eyes.  Maybe we should recycle, Or take shorter showers, But my mind lacks the ingenuity, To come up with a plan that empowers.  Trees are being cut down, Animals losing their home, But I'm not inventive enough, To find a way to atone.  The Earth is in danger, Mother Nature cries, But my mundane thoughts and ideas, Can't save it from its demise.  So I'll leave it to the experts, The brilliant minds to steer, For in the realm of creativity, I'm just an unremarkable pioneer.
