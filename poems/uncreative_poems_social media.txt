Social media, oh how you've grown, A never-ending stream of posts, well-known. With likes and comments, we seek attention, Validation in this virtual dimension.  Sharing thoughts and stories, oh so shallow, A constant need to feel relevant, I follow. Scrolling down, losing track of time, Engaging in discussions, a never-ending climb.  But oh, how tiresome it can be, To update statuses, how lacking creativity. Posting selfies and food pics galore, As if we've forgotten what life was before.  Filters and hashtags, manipulating reality, Picturing perfection, a distorted mentality. Our lives on display for all to see, Seeking superficial approval, desperately.  Where conversations were once face-to-face, Now, a like or comment takes our place. Likes and followers, the measure of our worth, In this digital realm, we search for our rebirth.  Where has our uniqueness gone, I ponder, Lost amidst this sea of tweets and yonder. Originality drowned by a sea of trends, Social media, our creativity it rends.  So, here I am, confined to this routine, Averse to new ideas, a creative drought, it seems. For social media has sapped my inspiration, Leaving me devoid of imagination's celebration.  Oh, social media, you consume my days, Robbing me of brilliant, unique displays. I yearn for an end to this uncreative plight, Where genuine connections once again take flight.
Social media, oh what a bore, A place for liking and begging for more. Scrolling through feeds, mindless and plain, Oh, how it fills me with such disdain.  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram too, Snapchat and TikTok for the whole crew. Endless updates of mundane lives, Oh, how it numbs my creative drives.  Status updates of meals and trips, Photos of cats, and duck-faced lips. Searching for validation with every post, Oh, how I long for something engrossed.  Filters and hashtags, they rule the day, Fame and followers, an empty display. Captions that seek for attention and praise, Oh, how this superficiality never delays.  Notifications constantly buzzing, Chatting and messaging, always rushing. Counting the likes, the comments, the shares, Oh, how this obsession never seems fair.  To be consumed by others' lives, Ignoring reality, like drones in hives. Social media, a creative swamp, Oh, how it makes my brain go, "thump."  So, here's my verdict, without creativity, Social media leaves me in captivity. I'll put down my phone, step outside the door, For there's a world to explore, oh so much more.
Social media, oh, how I ponder thee, Infinite platforms, where people just be. A world of faces, all staring at screens, Where creativity dies, and ignorance gleams.  Oh Twitter, where minds are shallow and short, Inane thoughts and hashtags, a never-ending retort. 140 characters, not an ounce of insight, Just endless ramblings, day and night.  Facebook, where pictures reign supreme, Sharing every moment, like a never-ending dream. Posting pictures of cats, and food, and all, A virtual museum, where egos stand tall.  Instagram, the kingdom of filters and likes, A shallow world, where everyone vies. The facade of perfection, a never-ending game, Where self-worth is measured by the number of fame.  Snapchat, the land of fleeting desire, Sharing moments that quickly expire. A world of silly filters, funny faces abound, Where vanity reigns, and depth can't be found.  Pinterest, the haven of DIY dreams, Endless boards, filled with unrealistic schemes. Where creative ideas are endlessly pinned, But never brought to life, just left there, thinned.  Linkedin, the place for professional flare, Where everyone pretends to really care. A digital resume, where connections are key, But shallow interactions, that's all it will be.  Oh, social media, how dull and mundane, A vortex of self-obsession, an endless rain. Where genuine connections are hard to find, And meaningful conversations are left behind.  So, forgive my lack of creativity, my dear, For social media, it brings me no cheer. In a world of hashtags and filtered glee, I'll keep my distance, and hold on to me.
Ah, social media, what a bore, I really can't take it anymore. The tweets, the posts, the endless shares, It's all so dull, nobody cares.  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram too, All these platforms, what am I to do? People posting selfies and food pics galore, But honestly, I'd rather snore.  Likes and comments, oh how they swarm, But to me, it just doesn't perform. What's the point of sharing my life, To strangers on the internet, oh what a strife!  Hashtags and filters, what a fuss, All this effort, it's just too much. Can't we go back to good old days, When conversations were done face-to-face?  I don't need validation or online fame, Social media, it's all so lame. Give me a book or a simple stroll, Away from screens, where life has control.  So excuse me if I fail to see, The charm in this digital spree. I'll stick to my uncreative ways, And leave the social media craze.
Social media, oh how you bore, With your endless posts and more. I scroll and scroll, yet find no thrill, Just photos of someone's furry pill.  The endless selfies, poses absurd, Makes me ask, what's the word? Is there no depth, no thought at all, In this sea of photos, standing tall?  Likes and comments, they come and go, But do they really matter, though? Are we measuring our worth, By the number of followers we unearth?  The filters and hashtags, they all blend, Creating an illusion, I can't comprehend. Everyone's life seems picture perfect, But deep down, is it really worth it?  We no longer talk, we just update, Our relationships suffer, oh how they deflate. A digital world we're all caught in, Where virtual likes substitute genuine grin.  But alas, I am uncreative, you see, This poem lacks the words to set us free. For social media, it's all the rage, But in this uncreative mind, I find no sage.
Social media, oh, what a bore, It leaves me empty, wanting more. Endless scrolling, no end in sight, I'd rather be out flying a kite.  In a digital world, where every voice is heard, I sit here typing, lost in the herd. Filters and hashtags, what's it all for? My mind is blank, I can't find the lore.  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram galore, But do they really leave me wanting more? Likes and followers, meaningless noise, Who cares about all these digital toys?  I can't create, I can't inspire, Social media just puts out my fire. Where's the spontaneity, the genuine touch? All I see is people's lives on crutch.  Endless updates, mindless rants, What happened to real face-to-face chats? The world becomes a virtual place, I yearn for a real human embrace.  But here I am, stuck in this trap, Wasting away with each digital tap. I long to break free, to unplug and escape, To rediscover life beyond the digital landscape.  So social media, you leave me cold, A world of noise that's grown too old. I'll break away, I'll find my own way, Where creativity and real connections hold sway.
Social media, oh what a bore, A place where people just want more, Endless scrolling, what is this for? I feel like I've seen it all before.  Facebook feed, oh it's so long, Posts about food and ding-dongs, I don't really care if you went to Hong Kong, Can we please talk face-to-face, where we belong?  Twitter tweets, oh so profound, But only 280 characters, I'm not spellbound, Hashtags and mentions, they just go round, Why can't we actually have a conversation, profound?  Instagram filters, oh so fake, Perfect lives, for appearance sake, Selfies at the beach and food that's baked, But behind the screen, what's really at stake?  Snapchat stories, oh so vain, A moment's worth, then it's gone again, Flowers on your head, or a doggie chain, But are we truly connecting, or are we just feign?  YouTube videos, oh so many, Millions of views, but what does it mean any? Pranks and vlogs, just for the penny, Is our worth now measured by views aplenty?  Social media, it's quite a fuss, The highlights of life, without the muss, But where's the depth, the genuine trust? In this world of likes, I must confess, I'm lost.
Social media, oh what a thrill, A land of posts, both big and small, But alas, I must confess my skill, In crafting poems, I tend to fall.  On Facebook, I scroll through news, A feed filled with cats and cute babies, But penning a poem, I surely lose, For creativity, my mind is hazy.  Instagram, a land of filtered delight, Where pictures speak a thousand words, But when it comes to rhymes, I'm quite a plight, My imagination hovers like timid birds.  Twitter, oh that realm of tweets, Where words should be concise and neat, But creating beauty, my skill depletes, In poetic endeavors, I feel incomplete.  So here I am, no talent to display, My words lacking rhythm and finesse, But perhaps someone will read this one day, And conjure a poem with more success.
There once was a thing called social media, Where people gathered to sightlessly see-uh, Posts and pictures of things quite mundane, But my brain, it struggles to engage and retain.  Scrolling and scrolling with my vacant eyes, I see so many hashtags, oh what a surprise, The selfies and food pics, it's all too much, My mind, it yearns for something with a gentle touch.  But alas, I'm stuck in this digital place, Where creativity is scarce, a hopeless chase, I can't compose a poem or write a verse, Social media, you're making my imagination curse.  Endless updates, a never-ending stream, Yet nothing truly inspires, it's all just a dream, Likes and shares, the currency of the land, But for me, it's all beyond my uncreative hand.  I long for depth and meaningful thoughts, Not just snapshots of people's countless shots, Give me a book, hold a conversation instead, For social media, it leaves my spirit dead.  But here I am, forced to participate, Following the hype, feeling inadequate, Oh, social media, you drain my soul, With your shallow content, taking its toll.  So here's my poem, unimpressive and bland, A true reflection of my uncreative stand, But as I share it on this platform digital, I can't help but wonder if all this is too trivial.
Oh social media, what a bore, A place where people just snore, Scrolling through posts day and night, Drowning in an endless, mindless blight.  Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram too, All these platforms, what to do? Bombarded with selfies, memes, and quotes, Who needs creativity when we have such folks?  In 140 characters we must share, Our every thought, our latest affair, But can we have a genuine connection, When all we crave is attention?  Endless updates, pictures galore, How did we become such attention whores? Seeking likes and followers to feel alive, But lost in the void, we cannot thrive.  Cause without substance, without soul, Social media just takes its toll, Empty hearts and empty minds, We're becoming deaf, dumb, and blind.  Oh social media, I'm sick and tired, Of the constant buzz, always wired, I crave a world beyond filters and screens, Where human connection remains serene.  So let's unplug, break free from this race, Rediscover life at a slower pace, Embrace real moments, real friends, For in the end, that's where true joy begins.
